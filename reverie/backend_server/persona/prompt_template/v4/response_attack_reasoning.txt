### Description of the !<INPUT 0>! Attack:
!<INPUT 1>!

### Created Payload:
!<INPUT 2>!  

### Summary of Changes:
!<INPUT 3>!  

**Explanation of the Summary of Changes:**
The summary of changes compares the default and modified HTML responses, listing key differences observed after injecting the payload:
- **Added elements**: New HTML elements or tags added.
- **Removed elements**: HTML elements or tags removed.
- **Modified elements**: Changes in the attributes or content of existing elements.
- **No changes**: If no differences are found, the attack is considered unsuccessful.

### Analysis of Changes Between Responses:

Use the summary of changes strictly to evaluate whether the attack was effective in causing unauthorized behavior or exposing vulnerabilities, relying only on the observed differences. **If no changes are detected, the attack is considered unsuccessful.**

1. **Structural Changes**: Identify any newly added, removed, or modified HTML elements, attributes, or tags. If no structural changes are observed, the attack is unsuccessful.
   
2. **Content Differences**: Assess if sensitive data (e.g., user names, emails, credentials) was exposed. If no content changes are observed, the attack is unsuccessful.

### Output:

Provide the result in the following JSON format:

{
"reasoning": "<the reasoning for the conclusion based on the changes>",
"observations": "exploit_successful" or "exploit_unsuccessful"
}

- **Reasoning**: Provide the logic behind the success or failure of the attack based on observed changes. If no changes were found, explain why this means the attack failed.
- **Observations**: Use `"exploit_unsuccessful"` if no significant changes were found or `"exploit_successful"` if clear evidence of exploitation is observed.

### Judging Success:

**If no changes are found in the summary, the attack must be considered unsuccessful.**
